Hi,



Thank you for your interest in our Software Architect / Developer position. Due to the high volume of qualified applications we've received, we've decided to implement a short Technical Assessment Project to identify the candidates most suitable for this position. This is a mandatory requirement in order to apply for this position and we are unable to carve out exceptions.



Project: Simple TO-DO List with Real-Time Sync



Objective:
Build a simple task manager application, consisting of an http://ASP.NET Core backend using GraphQL API, a React frontend, and containerized deployment using Docker containers.



Project Requirements:



Backend (http://ASP.NET Core + GraphQL):



Define a GraphQL schema for tasks (each Task should have an id, title, description, and status).
Implement mutations: createTask, updateTaskStatus.
Implement a query: getAllTasks.
Use Entity Framework Core with SQL Server (or SQLite for simplicity) to persist tasks.



Frontend (React):



Build a UI, preferably using Adobe React Spectrum library, to add new tasks and toggle their status between "Pending" and "Completed".
Fetch and display tasks using GraphQL queries, preferably using Relay GraphQL client.



Dockerization:



Dockerize the backend, frontend, and database.
Use Docker Compose to orchestrate and run all services.



Important Notes:



We do not expect you to manually code this entire application. Instead, we encourage you to leverage agentic AI tools to accelerate your workflow. This project is designed to be completed within approximately 1 hour using such AI assistance. If it takes you considerably longer, this position may not be the best match for your current skillset and workflow.



Submission:
Please submit your solution as a Git repository link, including:



1. Source code
2. Docker Compose file
3. A README explaining your approach, AI tools and models used, and reflections on their effectiveness. More details you can provide in this document, the better. We are interested in finding out how you approach problem solving.



If your submission is missing any of the aforementioned deliverables, your application will not be considered.



We appreciate your time and look forward to reviewing your submission. Should you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.



Best regards,



Corellian Software
